  and a strong interest in computational modeling.<br>\
  Over time, I've moved from Matlab to R, Python, and Rust — mostly for licensing reasons. \
  The transition wasn't easy. There aren't many structured resources, \
  only fragmented pieces of info scatterring here and there.<br>\
  Therefore, I've decided to set up this blog, \
  collating things that helped me along the way all in one place. <br>\
  Hopefully, they'll help others too.<br>\
